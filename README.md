## **Project Overview:**
In todayâ€™s competitive market, understanding customer behavior is key to business growth. This project leverages RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment customers based on their purchasing patterns.

By applying RFM analysis, we aim to:

Identify high-value customers and churn risks

Personalize marketing efforts for better ROI

Enhance customer lifetime value through data-driven strategies

This project walks through the complete pipeline of loading customer data, performing RFM scoring, creating segments, and deriving actionable business insights using Python.
